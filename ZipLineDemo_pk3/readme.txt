This is a demo map for the zip lines. It contains all the textures used in the
demo map in PNG format, so that the demo map can be played using any IWAD.

All of these textures are from Freedoom. Some of them, such as RW35_1BL, are
true colour versions of Freedoom textures, taken from the custom texture thread
on ZDoom forums.
